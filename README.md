# I-ForGer

I-ForGer is a German-language lexicon with words ordered along the informal-formal dimension. The lexicon is in CSV format and comprises continuous gradings of formality, i.e., scores between +1 (most formal) and -1 (most informal).

The 3,000 words were obtained utilizing lexicographic resources and sentence-based similarity computations. Crowdsourcing (data workers were German native speakers) and Best-worst scaling were used to assess their formality.
